            <p class="text">This website is the most recent project I've been working on! During my first semester of sophomore year (Fall 2021), I started learning how to make basic websites with HTML and CSS, and this website will hopefully represent what I've learned so far.</p>
            <p class="text">Since I will continue to make additions to this website as new projects or work get added to my resume, I will hopefully continously improve upon this page with new design changes, features, quality of life improvements, and other small touches. These small improvements will, in a sense, keep track of what I learn and choose to apply to this website. In that way, this project itself represents my assortment of web development skills in a medium that will be forever evolving.</p>
