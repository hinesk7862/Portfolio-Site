            <h3 class="text">3D FOOD PRINTING</h3>
            <p class="text">Summer of 2021, I worked at the CCDC Soldier Center in Natick, MA on a team developing 3D food printing technology for the potential of being used in the field. During my time there, another intern and I designed and lead multiple experiments to characterize 3 novel food formulations for printing in lab. These formulations were a mocha formulation, a buffalo chicken formulation, and an egg formulation.</p>
            <p class="text">I was also tasked with redesigning the UI/UX of a 3D printer currently being developed by a small research and development company partnered with the US Army. This UI/UX design would later be used and modified by that team to be used in user testing among the population of soldiers on base.</p>
            <p class="text">Lastly, I wrote a program for use within our experiments that allowed for the team to take a top-down picture of our sample and then characterize the basic material properties based on data within the image. This program was a python script using OpenCV that opened a designated file, filtered out the pictures background, and measured the width of a 3D printed line at multiple points. This enabled us to evaluate how rigid a formulation was once printed and how consistent the width was over the course of a print.</p>
