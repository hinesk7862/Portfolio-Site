            <h3 class="text">NEUTRON THERAPEUTICS</h3>
            <p class="text">From the Summer of 2020 to Spring of 2021, I worked as an CNC machinist intern at Neutron Therapeutics in Danvers, MA. They are an research and development company that sells cutting edge Boron Neutron Capture Therapy for noninvasive treatment of tumors.</p>
            <p class="text">I worked in the small onsite machine shop in their Danvers office space. Due to the size of the machine, most of the parts were outsourced and manufactured by larger dedicated machine shops, injection molding facilities, or ceramics manufacters; however, the machine shop operated a expidited service for manufacturing and remanufacturing of parts. While I was there, I worked on a range of parts that were often small enough to fit in the palm of your hands to large enough to fill the table of the 36" by 80" of the CNC. 
                Materials often included aluminum; hot and cold rolled steel; stainless steel; titanium; brass; delrin, PEEK, UMHW, and other polymers; and ceramics. Some parts are showcased to the left as an example of what I did during my time. Additionally, I was responsible for learning the operation and maitenance of a Hurco VM20 as part of my work along with the necessary CAM software to run parts, so I needed to teach myself this information before and during my time there.
